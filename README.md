# boilerplate-vanilla-spa
My boilerplate for a vanilla js spa, the main goal of this is to build an SPA with just basic javascript
no dependecies needed, yet, just run with:

`node index.js`

using es6-string-html extension will make it easier to code the html code in the return string
just prefix the return with
`/*html*/`


Mbola KAMO BE za anao documentation de aleo ny code no atao manazava azy xD

This ain't completed yet.. wait a bit more.. i'm still adding more features to it

I'm currently working on a virtual dom
